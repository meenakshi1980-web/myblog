        <p>I enjoy music and I listen it every single day. There are a lot of different styles of music for you to choose and enjoy. If I am in good mood, I prefer to listen some energy rock music that keep me happy and full of power.Not only listening to music, a music collection is a great hobby to have, too. Music makes me happy anytime anywhere then be it while walking, studying or cooking. It's my Soul Food</p>
