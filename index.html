        <p>I am a fun loving and adventurous person who loves to celebrate every moment in life. I am working as a Teacher at Whitehat Jr. as I love teaching children. My hobbies include adventurous sports, specially I want to try scuba diving and sky diving, listening to music, playing outdoor sports specially Badminton, playing Guitar and learning new things. I am a self motivated person who lives in a moment. My inspiration has always been Dr.Kiran Bedi for her Honesty and being Real and Saint Mother Teresa for her kindness.My aim is to be a good human being and a support for the people who needs it and just spread Goodness.<br><br> I am blessed with beautiful people around who are non-judgemental and have pure heart. My son is my strength around which my World revolves. He has been the purpose of my life. I believe in quality rather than quantity hence, I have only few close friends.<br><br> I live my life on my terms and alwayd do what my heart follows. I will always stand up for the Right even at the cost of standing alone afterall I am a LEo, a Lioness :)</p>

        <h2>Listening To Music</h2>
        <br>
        <p>I enjoy music and can listen it every single minute anytime. There are a lot of different styles of music for you to choose and enjoy. If I am in good mood, I prefer to listen some energy rock music that keep me happy and full of power.Not only listening to music, a music collection is a great hobby to have, too. Music makes me happy anytime anywhere then be it while walking, studying or cooking. It's my Soul Food</p>
